# PyTifeX

Explore and evaluate the behavior of Python type checkers.

## What is PyTifeX?

PyTifeX is an automated code generation tool for testing and evaluating different Python type checkers.
By leveraging LLMs through Pydantic-AI, PyTifeX can generate code examples that trigger false negatives and false positives in various type checkers.

The tool automatically analyzes and reconstructs closed GitHub issues from multiple type checker repositories, then regenerates those code examples in a way that introduces new variations likely to produce incorrect feedback — revealing potential weaknesses and inconsistencies in type checker behavior.
